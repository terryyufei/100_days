    <h1>Hi, I'm Terry Sophia</h1>

    <hr />

    <p>
      I am a software engineering student at Alx Africa, currently learning
      several programming languages including C, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and
      CSS. As a student, am focused on building a strong foundation in these
      programming languages and developing my skills in software development. My
      studies involve learning to write code, designing and implementing
      algorithms, and creating applications and software systems. Ultimately, my
      goal is to become a skilled and proficient software engineer who can
      develop innovative solutions to complex problems.

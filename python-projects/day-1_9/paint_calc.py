Instructions
You are painting a wall. 
The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. 
Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.
number of cans = (wall height x wall width) ÷ coverage per can.

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5

                           = 1.6

But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.
IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work.
